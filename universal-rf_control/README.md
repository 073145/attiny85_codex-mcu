Components:
ATtiny85 Microcontroller.
433MHz RF Transmitter Module.
Power Supply (e.g., 3.3V or 5V, depending on your RF module).
Capacitors (10uF and 100nF).
Resistors (if required by the RF module).
External Clock (if not using the internal oscillator).

Here's a description of how to connect these components:

ATtiny85 Connections:

VCC (Power): Connect to the positive terminal of your power supply (3.3V or 5V).

GND (Ground): Connect to the ground terminal of your power supply.

PB0 (RF Data Pin): Connect this pin to the data input of your 433MHz RF transmitter module. This pin will control the transmission of RF signals.

External Clock (if used): If you're using an external oscillator, connect it to the ATtiny85 pins (XTAL1 and XTAL2).

Bypass Capacitors: Connect a 100nF capacitor between VCC and GND near the ATtiny85. Also, add a 10uF capacitor between VCC and GND for power supply decoupling.


RF Transmitter Module Connections:

Data Input: Connect the data input pin of the RF transmitter module to PB0 of the ATtiny85.

VCC (Power): Connect to the positive terminal of your power supply (3.3V or 5V, matching the ATtiny85).

GND (Ground): Connect to the ground terminal of your power supply.

Antenna: Connect an antenna to the RF transmitter module (typically a short piece of wire).


Power Supply Connections:

Connect the positive terminal of the power supply to VCC of the ATtiny85 and the RF transmitter module.

Connect the ground terminal of the power supply to GND of the ATtiny85 and the RF transmitter module.
